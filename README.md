# MagicPiano
This is an HTML file that creates a web page with a virtual piano. The page includes a stylesheet (style.css) and some inline styling to style the piano keys.
The piano keys are created as div elements with class "piano-key" and are given a data attribute "note" to represent the note each key plays.
There are also "black" keys, which have a different width and height than the white keys and a black background color.
The keys can also have a "playing" or "highlighted" class added to them through JavaScript to change their background color.
The page also includes a heading and a paragraph element with the author's name. The body has a darkcyan background color.
